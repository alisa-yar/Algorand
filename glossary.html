            <h2>Transaction Fee</h2> 
            <p>Usually very small fees given to the miners involved in successfully approving a transaction on the blockchain.</p> 
            <p>This fee can vary depending on the difficulty involved in a transaction and overall network capabilities at that moment in time.</p>
            
            <h2>Block</h2>
            <p>The blockchain is made up of blocks. Each block holds a historical database of all cryptocurrency transactions made until the block is full.</p>
            
            <h2>Decentralized</h2> 
            <p>Not controlled, owned or managed by a single person or authority.</p>
            
            <h2>Block Finalization Time (or Finality)</h2>
            <p>The time needed to ensure that a new block is permanently added to the chain.</p>

            <h2>Block Proposal Time</h2>
            <p>The time it takes observers to become aware of which block is a candidate to be permanently added to the chain.</p>
            
            <h2>Protocols</h2> 
            <p>The set of rules that defines how data is exchanged across a network.</p>
            
            <h2>Fork</h2> 
            <p>When a new version of a blockchain is created, resulting in two versions of the blockchain running side-by-side.</p>

            <h2>Node</h2>
            <p>A computer and is responsible for allowing parties to participate in the decentralized database.</p>

            <h2>PoW (Proof of Work)</h2> 
            <p>An approach in which users race to solve very complex cryptographic puzzles, also known as mining.</p>
            <p>The first one to solve the puzzle has the right to append the next block to the chain and is rewarded for doing so.</p>

            <!-- <h2>Turing Completeness</h2> 
            <p>If a machine is capable of performing all conceivable programmable calculations, then it is Turing complete. This machine can process any computable function and includes most modern computers.</p> -->
            
            <h2>Byzantine agreement</h2> 
            <p>A protocol for getting nodes in a distributed system to agree on state change.</p>
