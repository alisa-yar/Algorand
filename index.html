        <h1>Algorand</h1>
        <article>
            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>Algorand is a blockchain network created in 2017 by Silvio Micali, an MIT professor who won the Turing Award for his work in cryptography.</p>
            <p>Algorand is a decentralized permissionless blockchain protocol that anyone can use to develop applications and transfer value.</p>
            <p>The Algorand protocol is powered by a novel consensus algorithm that enables fast, secure and scalable transactions.</p>
            <p>Algorand addresses the common issues that most older blockchains have, specifically concerning scalability and consensus.</p>
            <p>The blockchain uses Pure proof-of-stake (PPoS), a consensus protocol that selects validators at random according to the weight of their stake in ALGO coins.</p>

            <h2>Silvio Michali</h2>
            <p>At Algorand, Silvio oversees all research, including theory, security and crypto finance related to the decentralized blockchain.</p>
            <p>Aside from being an MIT faculty member since 1983, he is a member of the National Academy of Sciences, the National Academy of Engineering, the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and Accademia dei Lincei.</p>
            <p>Silvio received his Laurea in mathematics from the University of Rome, and his Ph.D. in computer science from the University of California at Berkeley.</p>
            <p>Silvio Micali (the founder): professor of c.s. at MIT, received the and Gödel prize and Turing award at 2012 for contributing to the theory and practice of secure 2-way computing electronic money cryptocurrencies and blockchain protocols.</p>
            <p>Inventor of zero knowledge proof, his PHD was about Byzantine agreement (a protocol for getting nodes in a distributed system to agree on state change).</p>

            <h2>The Blockchain Trilemma</h2>
            <p>The Algorand protocol is designed to solve three of the biggest problems most blockchains face: security, scalability and decentralization.</p>
            <p>Dubbed as the “blockchain trilemma”, the Algorand network claims to address the following three major issues.</p>
            <section>
                <h3>Security</h3>
                <p>The Algorand protocol is secure against malicious attacks, making it ideal for transacting, holding high-value assets and building secure enterprise applications.</p>
                <p>It maintains security on both network and consensus protocol levels and protects individual user's accounts.</p>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h3>Scalability</h3>
                <p>The Algorand protocol can handle a large number of transactions per second, making it a more scalable solution than Bitcoin or Ethereum.</p>
                <p>Algorand's consensus protocol does away with the need for computational power used in Bitcoin to solve cryptographic problems.</p>
                <p>Instead, the protocol's computation cost per user is only used to generate and verify signatures, as well as operations requiring simple counting.</p>
                <p>According to Algorand, it can “scale to millions of users and sustain a high transaction rate without incurring significant cost to participating users".</p>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h3>Decentralization</h3>
                <p>Algorand is entirely decentralized with no central authority or singular locus of control.</p> 
                <p>Transactions are verified by participating nodes in the network and each node has an equal say in decision-making. This makes Algorand a very decentralized system.</p>
                <p>Everyone on the network also has a chance of being part of the committee of users that approve each block because the selection is both random and confidential. There is no fixed committee and its nodes are run by people from all over the world.</p>
